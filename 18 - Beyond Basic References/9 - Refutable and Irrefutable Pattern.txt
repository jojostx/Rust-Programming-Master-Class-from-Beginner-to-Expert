A pattern in Rust is refutable if it can fail to match some possible values.

A pattern is irrefutable if it always matches any value of the type it's used with.

This distinction is important, because:

Some contexts (like let, function parameters) require irrefutable patterns.

Others (like match, if let) allow refutable patterns.

🔹 Table Explanation
Here’s the table you provided, explained with examples:

Pattern	Refutability	Explanation
a	Irrefutable	a is a variable binding—it matches everything, so it never fails.
_	Irrefutable	The wildcard pattern _ also matches everything, just ignores the value.
MyStruct { f1: x, f2: y }	Irrefutable	If you're matching a value of type MyStruct, this struct pattern matches it completely (no conditions).
Some(b)	Refutable	Option<T> can be Some(T) or None. This pattern only matches Some, so it may fail—it's refutable.
Err(MyError::Foo)	Refutable	Result<T, E> can be Ok(_) or Err(_). This pattern matches only a specific variant, so it may fail—it's refutable.

🔍 Detailed Examples
✅ Irrefutable Pattern
rust
Copy
Edit
let x = 5;           // always matches → irrefutable
let Some(y) = Some(3); // ❌ ERROR! This is refutable!
The last line fails to compile because let expects an irrefutable pattern, but Some(y) might not match (e.g., if it was None).

You need to use a match or if let:

rust
Copy
Edit
if let Some(y) = Some(3) {
    println!("Matched: {}", y);
}
✅ Struct Pattern is Irrefutable
rust
Copy
Edit
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

let p = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };

// This is irrefutable because `p` is of type Point
let Point { x: a, y: b } = p;
This always works — all fields are present and matched — no chance of failure.

✅ Refutable Example with Option
rust
Copy
Edit
let maybe = Some(10);

match maybe {
    Some(x) => println!("Got {}", x), // ✅ will match if it's Some
    None => println!("Nothing"),      // ✅ handles failure case
}
But if you wrote:

rust
Copy
Edit
let Some(x) = maybe; // ❌ error: pattern `Some(_)` is refutable
It won’t compile unless you handle the failure case.

🧠 Summary
Pattern Kind	Can it fail to match?	Used in let?	Used in match?
Irrefutable	❌ No	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
Refutable	✅ Yes	❌ No	✅ Yes
