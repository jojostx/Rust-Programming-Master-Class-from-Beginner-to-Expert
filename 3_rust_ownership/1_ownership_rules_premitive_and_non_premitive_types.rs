// -------------------------------------------
// 			Rust Ownership
// 			- Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// 			- There can be only one owner at a time.
// 			- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
// -------------------------------------------

fn main() {

    // primitives: bools, chars, static strings, integers, floats, fixed-size arrays
    // are copied and not moved because they're stored on the stack and their sizes can be
    // determined at compile time
